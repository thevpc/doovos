 *             Doovos (Distributed Object Oriented Operating System)
 *
 * Doovos is a new Open Source Distributed Object Oriented Operating System
 * Design and implementation based on the Java Platform.
 * Actually, it is a try for designing a distributed operation system in
 * top of existing centralized/network OS.
 * Designed OS will follow the object oriented architecture for redefining
 * all OS resources (memory,process,file system,device,...etc.) in a highly
 * distributed context.
 * Doovos is also a distributed Java virtual machine that implements JVM
 * specification on top the distributed resources context.
 *
 * Doovos Kernel is the heart of Doovos OS. It implements also the Doovos JVM
 * Doovos Kernel code is executed on host JVM
